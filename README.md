        About me:
    </u>
</h1>

ðŸŽ“ I recently completed **my Master of Science in Computer Engineering â€“ Bioinformatics** at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), where I worked as a **Graduate Research Assistant** during my studies.

During this time, I was involved in research at two laboratories:

- ðŸ©º **Biomedical Signal and Image Processing Laboratory (BiSIPL)**  
  *Department of Electrical Engineering*   
  I worked on biomedical image analysis using deep learning methods, with a focus on diagnostic applications.

- ðŸ¤– **Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Laboratory (RIML)**  
  *Department of Computer Engineering*  
  My work focused on interpretable and robust machine learning models, particularly for bioinformatics and computer vision tasks.
